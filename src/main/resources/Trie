Trie
(Index in Dictionaries, spelling checks)

Normal Tries
  Each node has R (256 ASCII characters) children
  Store value at the the end of the word to mark there is a word (Maybe a page number)
  Root is always blank
  
  Put recursively add each char until length of key is reached and the put the value
  
  Get
    Recursively check if last char has value or char has null value
    return null or value
  
  Complexity
    Sublinear logN
    
  Lot of null links so wastage of space
  
  
  
Ternary Search Trie (TST)
   Each node has 3 links 
    Left link is for the word starting with lower value character than parent and right with higher value
    Middle links are next word links
    End of the word has a value associated with the node
    
   Search (Recursion)
    Move to middle link until next word is a match
    If not then move to left or right , if its not match then search miss
    
   Put (Recursion)
    Move to middle until next is match
    Otherwise move to left or right
    If null link is encountered then create new node and put next chars to the middle of new mode
    
   Complexity
    Search logN
    Put logN
    
   Less memory
   
   Improvement - create R roots based on characters



Character based operations of trie
  Prefix or wildcard match (Autocomplete)
  Longest Prefix (Routing table of ip addresses)

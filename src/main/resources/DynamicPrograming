Break down a problem in smaller sub-problems and solve it.

Memoization
    Solve it using a basic recursive algorithm. (focus on correctness)
    Break Down a problem by plotting the recursive calls in a tree
    Find Duplicates in the tree
    Save the results of duplicates in a map or any relevant DS (memo) and use it in future calls
    This reduces the time complexity
    The time complexity can be visualized by considering teh height of the tree and number of subtrees

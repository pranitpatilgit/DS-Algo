Graph

Representation using adjecency list
  Each Vertex has a list of vertices which it can connect to
  
DFS (Can be used to see if vertex is connected to another vertex via a path)
  Recursion
  Create a array to store if vertex is marked and an array to store from where we visited  this vertex (to back trace the path)
  Visit every edge and mark the vertex as visited
  Recursively do this until we get all visited or null vertices in adjecency list of one of the vertex 
    and then back track using the backtrack array and do the same recursion until
    
  private void dfs(Graph g, int v){
    visited[v] = true;
    for(int neighbour : g.getAdjecencyList(v)){
      if(!visited(neighbour)){
        dfs(g, neighbour)
        backtrack[neighbour] = v;
      }
    }
  }
  


BFS (Can get shortest path)
  Using Queue
  Mark the vertex as visited
  Push all adjecent unmarked vertices to queue
  Process from queue until its empty


Connected Components
  gives if both vertices are connected in constant time
  Uses DFS
  
  Visit all the vertices using DFS
  Mark the visited ones and put the set one single identifier of all connected vertices in an extra array
  After the DFS is complete move to next unmarked vertex and perform same steps

----------------

Diagraphs
Find all the vertices reachable from a vertex
    Use DFS
    All Visited are reachable
DFS in Diagraph Application - Mark and Sweep Garbage Collection
BFS in Diagraph Application - Web crawler

Topological Sort
    Arrange the acyclic graph to sequence like a flow chart
    Use DFS , put a vertex in a stack once its done processing i.e. no more edges to go

Connected components in Diagraph / Strong components
    Find topological sort of the diagraph
    Pop from stack and run dfs on the that and mark all connected vertices in same connected component
    continue until stack is empty
